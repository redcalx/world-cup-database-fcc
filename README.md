# world-cup-database-fcc
SQL project part of the 'Relational Database' course from freeCodeCamp.org. The database contains data of a few games from the final rounds of the 2014 and 2018 FIFA World Cup. As part of one of the challenges of the project, the shell scripts insert the data from a CSV file into the database and make queries prompted by the tasks of the project.
